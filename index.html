      <p><strong>Somalia’s journey began with unparalleled hope.</strong> In 1960, two territories — British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland — united to form the Somali Republic, a rare African nation born with one language, one religion, and one culture. The world admired us. We stood tall with promise — a young country determined to shape its destiny through unity, peace, and self-determination.</p>

      <p><strong>But that promise did not last.</strong></p>

      <p>The military coup of 1969 changed the course of our history. And yet, in its early years, the military regime showed a glimpse of what Somalia could have become — a nation where corruption was punished, discipline upheld, and national development prioritized. It was a time when the machinery of government, though authoritarian, functioned with clarity and purpose. Many Somalis recall those years as a moment when the state still had credibility and direction.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, that discipline quickly gave way to dysfunction. Within a few years, the regime began practicing the very corruption it once condemned. Nepotism took root. Tribal favoritism replaced national merit. The regime started suppressing opposition and deepening clan divisions instead of uniting the people. What could have been a new chapter of progress turned instead into a legacy of repression and fragmentation — a path that would later spiral into civil war.</p>

      <p>That war, beginning in the early 1990s, shattered Somalia's institutions, unleashed decades of violence, and tore apart the social fabric of the nation. What followed were warlordism, extremist groups, foreign interventions, and a broken political process that continues to struggle with legitimacy and unity. Today, Somalia still faces the consequences of that collapse: a fragile state, deep mistrust, and enduring pain.</p>

      <p><strong>And yet, despite all this, the Somali people endure.</strong></p>

      <p>From Mogadishu to the diaspora, Somalis have rebuilt homes, raised children, and sustained communities with ingenuity and resolve. Somali women have borne the greatest burdens, holding families together through hardship and crisis. Our people remain resourceful, entrepreneurial, and proud.</p>

      <p><strong>But resilience alone is not enough. Survival is not justice.</strong> After over 60 years of independence and more than 30 years of turmoil, we must face a hard truth: Somalia cannot move forward without true reconciliation.</p>

      <p><strong>This is not a new idea.</strong> Many Somali intellectuals — scholars, elders, poets, and professionals — have long called for reconciliation as the only way forward. Their warnings have gone unheeded for too long. The missing ingredients in Somalia’s long search for peace have always been truth, forgiveness, and justice. Not just peace agreements signed by elites, but grassroots healing embraced by the people. We must forgive — not to forget the crimes of the past, but to unshackle ourselves from their grip and chart a new path toward national unity.</p>

      <p><strong>Reconciliation is not a slogan; it is a national necessity.</strong></p>

      <p>But healing the nation requires more than institutional reform. It requires personal responsibility. Every Somali — whether in Mogadishu or Baidoa, Kismayo or Minneapolis — must see the salvation of the nation as their own duty. We must shed the mindset that change comes from above. Real change begins in our homes, our neighborhoods, and our communities.</p>

      <p>We can no longer wait for the perfect leader. We must choose better leaders — selfless, honest, and service-minded individuals — in every sector of our society. Whether at the federal, regional, or local level, we must elect those who seek to serve, not to rule. The days of tolerating leaders who divide us for personal gain must come to an end.</p>

      <p><strong>Let us not forget:</strong> Somalia's brokenness is not inevitable. It is the result of choices — and it can be reversed through new choices.</p>

      <p><strong>Speak truth. Forgive boldly. Demand accountability. Mentor the youth. Organize your community.</strong> The smallest act of responsibility can become the spark of national transformation.</p>

      <p><strong>Somalia is not finished. Somalia is not beyond repair.</strong> We are a people of rich culture, deep faith, and immense potential. Our dream of a unified, just, and peaceful Somalia is still alive — but we must work for it, sacrifice for it, and believe in it together.</p>

      <p><strong>Let this generation be remembered as the one that turned bitterness into belief, division into unity, and delay into action.</strong> Let this be the generation that chose forgiveness, justice, and leadership rooted in moral courage.</p>

      <p><strong>Let us rise — not for ourselves alone, but for the future of Somalia.</strong></p>
